# PasswordsGenerator-py

This code generates a random password that is 8 characters long and returns it. The password is checked to see if it is a valid password using the is_valid_password function. A valid password is defined as one that contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If the password is not valid, the get_password function will continue to generate and check random passwords until a valid one is found.
